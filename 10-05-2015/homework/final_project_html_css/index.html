				<p class="title">What is Design</p>
				<p class="regular">Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system. Design has different connotations in different fields. In some cases the direct construction of an object is also considered to be design.</p>

				<p class="regular">Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research,thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes and even methods of designing.</p>

				<p class="subtitle">Definitions</p>

				<p class="regular">More formally design has been defined as follows:</p>	

				<p class="regular">(noun) a specification of an object, manifested by an agent, intended to accomplish goals, in a particular environment, using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of requirements, subject to constraints;</p>

				<p class="regular">(verb, transitive) to create a design, in an environment (where the designer operates)</p>

				<p class="regular">Another definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective.</p>
